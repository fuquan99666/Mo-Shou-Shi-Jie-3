well,this is a big homework for a new man in the college.
Though it didn't use so many new tools or knowledge , but I think it is still difficulty for our students who are poor in the computer programming.
But I still completed this by myself in these days , so I think it is a very nice thing for me.
Meanwhile,I think it may help the students who also will experience this "moshoushijei" and can't find a good way to solve it ——this code may help you find the big direction!
